# Welcome to the Vention Front End Interview!
The goal of this test is to create some interactive cards using HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript.

## Rules
- No frameworks. Vanilla JS and CSS/SCSS only (no Bootstrap).
- The display for the cards should be responsive.
- Provide access to your code, e.g. link to a GitHub repo.
- **Important**: The content must be data-driven. It should be dynamic and not a static list of HTML elements.
- Thatâ€™s it!

## What to Build
The card states are shown on the next page. The image should fade and a button should appear when the card is hovered
over. When an item is added to the cart, an icon should appear on the top left-hand corner of the card indicating that
it has been added to the cart. A new button should now appear allowing you to remove the item from the cart, which
resets the card back to its original state.
